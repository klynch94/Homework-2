# Homework-2
I created this portfolio website during my time at Northwestern Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. The assignment was as follows:

Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

A navbar

A responsive layout

Responsive images

The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries


I started by creating 3 basic webpages - About Me, Portfolio, and Contact. I created a consistent and responsive Navbar and added additional CSS styling to make it my own. I also added a gradient for the body because it is more of my own style. 

Here are the 3 pages:

About Me

Portfolio
<img src="Assets/PortfolioExample.jpg">

Contact
<img src="Assets/ContactExample.jpg">

Below are 3 images that demonstrate the responsiveness of the website:
